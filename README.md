# 🧠 ResumeMind – AI-Powered Resume Review

Welcome to **ResumeMind**, an AI-powered resume review web application built using **React 17**, **React Router**, and **Puter**. This project helps users upload their resume, converts it to an image, and provides intelligent feedback using AI models — making resume building and improvement faster, smarter, and more insightful.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🖼 Upload and preview resumes in PDF/image format
- 🧠 AI-generated resume feedback (Summary, ATS score, detailed suggestions)
- ☁️ Cloud storage for resumes and metadata
- ⚙️ Virtual compute for AI-based processing
- 🔐 Authentication system with protected routes
- 📦 Key-Value storage for resume data
- 🌐 Seamless routing with React Router
- 📊 ATS (Applicant Tracking System) analysis and scoring

## 🛠 Tech Stack

| Technology | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **React 17** | Frontend library for building UI |
| **React Router** | Routing between pages |
| **Puter** | Cloud backend service used for:
- File system access (for resume storage)
- Key-value store (for metadata)
- Virtual compute (to run AI logic)
- Authentication (to protect user data) |
| **TailwindCSS** | Styling and responsive layout |
| **AI Models** | Integrated with resume analysis model via virtual compute |
| **Blob + Object URLs** | To render PDF/image previews securely |
| **Typescript (optional)** | For type safety with feedback structures |

## 🧪 Key Modules Explained

### 1. **Resume Upload & Display**
- Users upload their resume (PDF)
- The backend stores the resume and converts it to image
- Image preview and PDF view both rendered securely using `Blob` URLs

### 2. **AI Feedback (via Virtual Compute)**
- Once the resume is uploaded, a cloud function (via Puter compute) triggers analysis
- AI model returns:
  - Summary
  - ATS Score
  - Detailed suggestions for improvement

### 3. **Data Storage**
- Resume data stored using Puter’s `fs` (file system) API
- Metadata and feedback stored in `kv` (key-value) store

### 4. **Authentication**
- Uses Puter’s `auth` object to check if the user is logged in
- If not authenticated, redirects user to `/auth`

### 5. **Routing**
- Routes handled using React Router:
  - `/` – Home
  - `/resume/:id` – Resume review page
  - `/auth` – Login/register page

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

```text
If user is not authenticated →
  redirect to /auth?next=/resume/:id
Else →
  load resume, image, and feedback
```

## 📸 Screenshot (Preview Layout)

```text
+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|             Resume Image            |           AI Feedback             |
|  (left pane - PDF preview or image) | (right pane - summary, ATS score) |
+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
```

## 🧾 API Usage (AI Models)

> ⚠️ You need proper access tokens / API keys for AI-based feedback functions.

Example:
```js
const result = await ai.call('resume-review', { file });
```

---

## ✅ To Do / Next Steps

- [ ] Add dark mode support
- [ ] Add ability to re-run feedback
- [ ] Add download feedback as PDF option
- [ ] Improve ATS scoring model integration
- [ ] Add support for multiple resume uploads
